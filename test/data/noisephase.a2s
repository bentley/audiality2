// This test is probably best verified by recording the output and observing it
// in an audio editor. The correct output is a "fractured" sine wave that's
// fractured exactly at zero crossings - never anywhere else. This result
// indicates that the noise generator is issuing two sample-and-hold levels for
// each period, at the same frequency as the sine oscillator.
